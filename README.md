# TestTask

This repository contains two tasks focused on different machine learning challenges:

## Folder Structure

- `Task1_MNIST`
This folder contains code for training and evaluating various classifiers on the MNIST dataset. It includes helper functions and interfaces to facilitate model training and inference.

- `Task2_NER_CV`
This folder contains the code and files necessary for an animal classification task using both image classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER). The system matches an image of an animal with a textual description.

## Notebooks
The repository also includes two `.ipynb` notebooks demonstrating how the models work
